\section{Description}

\paragraph{Goal} The most popular route suggestion engines minimize the expected time to a destination based on maximizing speed while minimizing distance. Surprisingly, these models use real-time data as reported by users to determine congestion without any predictive element. Our first goal is to use taxi data as a proxy for traffic in Manhattan. This is the first step in creating a better route suggestion engine.

\paragraph{Data} In 2013 the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) began publicly releasing detailed yellow taxi, green taxi, and limousine ride information. Each data point included date, time, GPS location of pickup and dropoff, trip distance, payment type, and trip cost. We will be bucketing that data into different neighborhoods, with the precision of the neighborhood specification to be determined.

\section{Proposal}

Here you explain how you will cycle through Box's loop \citep{box1976science}.
(Make sure to include references.) You may have some subsections like those
below. Feel free to include a picture if you would like. Make sure everything
fits into a single page, including references.
